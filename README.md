LOAN APPROVAL DATA ANALYSIS


In modern times, loans are crucial for various purposes like education, housing, and lifestyle needs. Banks profit significantly from loan services. However, approving loans requires careful consideration of applicant profiles.

We aim to develop a model predicting loan approval based on applicant background information like gender, marital status, income, etc. The project follows a standard Machine Learning (ML) life cycle:

Data Collection: Gather diverse data including loan history, customer details, and credit scores.

Data Cleaning: Clean data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand relationships between variables, identifying patterns and insights using visualization tools.

Feature Engineering: Modify or create new features to enhance model performance, such as transforming variables or encoding categorical data.

Data Splitting: Split dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate ML algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines for loan approval prediction.

Model Training: Train selected model using training data, allowing it to learn patterns in the data.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the testing dataset.

By following this ML life cycle, we aim to build a robust model that accurately predicts loan approval, aiding both banks and loan applicants in decision-making.
